This section provides a general overview of how Cypher parses an input String, including whitespace.
--

Cypher considers input Strings as a sequence of Unicode UTF-16 code points. Unicodes can generally be escaped as `\uxxx`.

Additional documentation on escaping rules for string literals, names and regular expressions can be found here:

* xref::syntax/expressions.adoc#cypher-expressions-string-literals[String literal escape sequences]
* xref::syntax/naming.adoc#symbolic-names-escaping-rules[Using special characters in names]

== Supported Whitespace

In Cypher, whitespace can be used as a separator between keywords but has no function otherwise.

The following characters are considered as whitespace:
